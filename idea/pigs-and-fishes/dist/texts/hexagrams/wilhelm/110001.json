{"number":41,"id":"110001","title":{"pinyin":"","wadeGiles":"Sun","english":"Decrease"},"structure":{"above":"KÃªN KEEPING STILL, MOUNTAIN","below":"TUI THE JOYOUS, LAKE"},"description":"This hexagram represents a decrease of the lower trigram in favor of the upper, because the third line, originally strong, has moved up to the top, and the top line, originally weak, has replaced it. What is below is decreased to the benefit of what is above. This is out-and-out decrease. If the foundations of a building are decreased in strength and the upper walls are strengthened, the whole structure loves its stability. Likewise, a decrease in the prosperity of the people in favor of the government is out-and-out decrease. And the entire theme of the hexagram is directed to showing how this shift of wealth can take place without causing the sources of wealth can take place without causing the sources of wealth in the nation and its lower classes to fail.","judgement":{"text":"DECREASE combined with sincerity\nBrings about supreme good fortune\nWithout blame.\nOne may be persevering in this.\nIt furthers one to undertake something.\nHow is this to be carried out?\nOne may use two small bowls for the sacrifice.","commentary":"Decrease does not under all circumstances mean something bad. Increase and decrease come in their own time. What matters here is to understand the time and not to try to cover up poverty with empty pretense. If a time of scanty resources brings out an inner truth, one must not feel ashamed of simplicity. For simplicity is then the very thing needed to provide inner strength for further undertakings. Indeed, there need by no concern if the outward beauty of the civilization, even the elaboration of religious forms, should have to suffer because of simplicity. One must draw on the strength of the inner attitude to compensate for what is lacking in externals; then the power of the content makes up for the simplicity of form. There is no need of presenting false appearances to God. Even with slender means, the sentiment of the heart can be expressed."},"image":{"text":"At the foot of the mountain, the lake:\nThe image of DECREASE.\nThus the superior man controls his anger\nAnd restrains his instincts.","commentary":"The lake at the foot of the mountain evaporates. In this way it decreases to the benefit of the mountain, which is enriched by its moisture. The mountain stands as the symbol of stubborn strength that can harden into anger. The lake is the symbol of unchecked gaiety that can develop into passionate drives at the expense of the life forces. Therefore decrease is necessary; anger must be decreased by keeping still, the instincts must be curbed by restriction. By this decrease of the lower powers of the psyche, the higher aspects of the soul are enriched."},"lines":[{"number":1,"text":"Nine at the beginning means:\nGoing quickly when one's tasks are finished\nIs without blame.\nBut one must reflect on how much one may decrease others.","commentary":"It is unselfish and good when a man, after completing his own urgent tasks, uses his strength in the service of others, and without bragging or making much of it, helps quickly where help is needed. But the man in a superior position who is thus aided must weigh carefully how much he can accept without doing the helpful servant or friend real harm. Only where such delicacy of feeling exists can one give oneself unconditionally and without hesitation."},{"number":2,"text":"Nine in the second place means:\nPerseverance furthers.\nTo undertake something brings misfortune.\nWithout decreasing oneself,\nOne is able to bring increase to others.","commentary":"A high-minded self-awareness and a consistent seriousness with no forfeit of dignity are necessary if a man wants to be of service to others. He who throw himself away in order to do the bidding of a superior diminishes his own position without thereby giving lasting benefit to the other. This is wrong. To render true service of lasting value to another, one must serve him without relinquishing oneself."},{"number":3,"text":"Six in the third place means:\nWhen three people journey together,\nTheir number increases by one.\nWhen one man journeys alone,\nHe finds a companion.","commentary":"When there are three people together, jealousy arises. One of them will have to go. Avery close bond is possible only between two people. But when one man is lonely, he is certain to find a companion who complements him."},{"number":4,"text":"Six in the fourth place means:\nIf a man deceases his faults,\nIt makes the other hasten to come and rejoice.\nNo blame.","commentary":"A man's faults often prevent even well-disposed people from coming closer to him. His faults are sometimes reinforced by the environment in which he lives. But if in humility he can bring himself to the point of giving them up, he frees his well-disposed friends from an inner pressure and causes them to approach the more quickly, and there is mutual joy."},{"number":5,"text":"Six in the fifth place means:\nSomeone does indeed increase him.\nTen pairs of tortoises cannot oppose it.\nSupreme good fortune.","commentary":"If someone is marked out by fate for good fortune, it comes without fail. All oracles-as for instance those that are read from the shells of tortoises-are bound to concur in giving him favorable signs. He need fear nothing, because his luck is ordained from on high."},{"number":6,"text":"Nine at the top means:\nIf one is increased without depriving other,\nThere is no blame.\nPerseverance brings good fortune.\nIt furthers one to undertake something.\nOne obtains servants\nBut no longer has a separate home.","commentary":"There are people who dispense blessings to the whole world. Every increase in power that comes to them benefits the whole of mankind and therefore does not bring decrease to others. Through perseverance and zealous work a man wins success and finds helpers as they are needed. But what he accomplishes is not a limited private advantage; it is a public good and available to everyone."}]}
