The first line is the leader of its kind, so when it initiates action, the others follow, just like the rush plants that get pulled up together.

This is why it says that he \"does not leave out those who are far away.\" Free from personal considerations and utterly impartial, he abides in \"the bright and the great [Dao].\"[[note 5]] This is why \"cliques disappear.\" In this way, he thus can \"succeed in being worthy of the practice of centrality [the Mean].\" The word shang [usually \"esteem\"] here means \"be worthy of.\"[[note 6]] \"Practice of centrality\" refers to the fifth line [i.e., the middle line in the upper trigram].}","commentary":"\"One here embraces the uncouth\" and \"succeeds in being worthy of the practice of centrality [the Mean]\" by implementing the bright and great [Dao]."},{"number":3,"text":"Third Yang\nThere is no flat that does not eventually slope; there is no going away that does involve a return, but one who practices constancy in the face of difficulty will be without blame.

Thus the third line occupies a position at the boundary of Heaven and Earth and [as a yang line] is about to return to its proper place [above, i.e., Heaven]. When it actually does return to its proper place, as a superior [Third Yang] will keep to noble station, and as a subordinate [Fourth Yin] will keep to a humble station.[[note 7]] This is why \"there is no going away that does not involve a return\" and \"no flat that does not eventually slope.\" Here one is situated at the point where the route between Heaven and Earth is about to be blocked and where the level road is about to slope, things that signify that a moment of great flux is about to occur and the world is about to undergo radical change. Thus one does not neglect his uprightness while in repose and does not neglect the proper response while engaged in action. Here in the face of difficulty, if one is able to practice constancy, he will not lose his righteousness. This is why he \"will be without blame.\" This is someone who faithfully practices righteousness and sincerity, so, free of any grief over his own faithfulness, he achieves spontaneous understanding of what is here involved.

Here a female occupies a noble position, treading a central course [staying on the path of the Mean] and abiding in compliance. Lowering herself to resonate with Second Yang, she enters into a mutual relationship of effect and response. As she employs the virtue of centrality to carry out her wishes, she does not violate the propriety involved. The statement \"the sovereign Yi gave his younger sister in marriage\" is truly in accord with this concept. She treads the way of compliance and abides in centrality [the Mean], so when she carries out her wishes it results in blessings.

This identification was first proposed by Yu Fan (164-233 A.D.); his comments are quoted in the Zhouyi jijie (Collected exegeses on the Changes of the Zhou) of Li Dingzuo (eighth century A.D.), 4: 79, and seem to be based on evidence given in the Zuozhuan (Zuo's chronicles on the Spring and Autumn Annals), in a passage concerning the ninth year of the reign of Duke Ai (487 B.C.); see Legge, The Chinese Classics, 5: 819. However, \"Yi\" is included among a number of Shang kings' names, and it is by no means certain that the Zuozhuan and Yu Fan are correct. There is also controversy over whether it is a daughter or a younger sister who is given in marriage. \"Gave in marriage\" translates gui, which literally means \"[caused to] return.\" This involves a \"return\" to the husband's family. Note that the phrase \"Sovereign Yi gave his younger sister in marriage\" also occurs in Hexagram 54, Guimei (Marrying Maiden), Fifth Yin."}]}
