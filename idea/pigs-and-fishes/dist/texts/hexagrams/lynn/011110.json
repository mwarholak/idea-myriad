With the suppression of the dao of errancy, the Dao of No Errancy is achieved, so what could happen here but great prevalence and fitting constancy? When \"the hard and strong comes from without and becomes the ruler within,\" the dao of weakness and wickedness, of course, vanishes. The more the action, the greater the strength, so the Dao of hardness and straightforwardness works smoothly. \"The hard and strong attains centrality [the Mean] and resonance,\" so virtue commensurate with Heaven shines forth. Thus \"one here attains great prevalence through righteousness.\" As this is the declared will of Heaven, how could one possibly disobey? How could one possibly fall into error? This is why \"if one is not righteous, it would mean disaster, and it would not be fitting should he set out to do something.\"} \"If one is not righteous, it would mean disaster, and it would not be fitting should he set out to do something\": If one were so to set out here in No Errancy, where, indeed, would he go?
