As water flows in but does not fill it up, so one faces danger but does not violate his trust. {Here there is an extreme of dangerous steepness, and this is why water flows but cannot fill it up. Though one is located in extreme danger, he does not neglect his strength and centrality, and though he faces such danger, he does not violate his trust: this is what \"The Constant Sink Hole\" means.} The reason \"the heart and mind should prevail\" is that one fills one's middle with hardness and strength, and the reason \"one's actions will enjoy esteem\" is that when one sets forth, he achieves merit. {One constantly practices [xi] how to deal with the Sink Hole, so when one goes to the land of the Sink Hole, he will be able to use every advantage against it, and this is why \"when one sets forth,\" surely \"he achieves merit.\" The strategic condition [literally, \"danger\"] of Heaven consists of there being no way to climb up to it, {It is because one cannot manage to climb up to it that Heaven preserves its exalted majesty.} and strategic conditions on Earth consist of mountains, rivers, hills, and high ground. {If people have mountains, rivers, hills, and high ground, they can preserve their integrity.} Kings and dukes provide themselves with strategic conditions in order to protect their states. {States rely on strategic conditions to protect themselves. The conclusion is that from Heaven and Earth on down nothing can do without strategic conditions.} When the time comes for strategic conditions to play their role, their usefulness is indeed great! {It is not a matter of using them on a regular basis, but their use comes into play when the time demands it.}"},"image":{"text":"Water keeps coming on: this constitutes the image of the Constant Sink Hole.[[note 2]] In the same way, the noble man consistently practices virtuous conduct and constantly engages in moral transformation","commentary":"{With extreme danger unrelieved, moral transformation must not be neglected.

In such danger yet unable to save oneself, in the Sink Hole to begin with and then fallen into its very drain hole: this indicates someone who has lost the Dao [i.e., \"his way\"] and now lies exhausted at the bottom of the Sink Hole.

As Second Yang stays within the Mean [i.e., it is located in the middle position of the lower trigram] and as it gets on well with First Yin and Third Yin, so it can \"strive for small attainments.\" But First Yin and Third Yin lack the wherewithal to be of help to Second Yang, and this is why the text says \"small attainments.\"}","commentary":"\"This one may strive for small attainments\" but has not yet found his way out from inside [of the Sink Hole and danger]."},{"number":3,"text":"Third Yin\nWhether one comes or goes, there is a Sink Hole before him.

To set out would result in going to the one Sink Hole, but to stay would mean the other.

He might stay put, but no place offers security. This is why the text says: \"In danger and stuck here too.\" \"Whether one comes or goes,\" there is a Sink Hole in either case.

Here a strong and a weak line each obtain their rightful places, so there is no question of mutually incompatible positions. Neither line is in resonance with any of the remaining lines, so here they fulfill this carrying and contiguous relationship. Expression of bright sincerity here has nothing to do with external ornamentation. Located in the Sink Hole under such circumstances, although Fourth Yin repays [the sovereign, Fifth Yang] with one cup of wine and two bowls of food, it is earthenware vessels that provide such extremely plain fare, and they are handed in through the window.[[note 4]] As such, they are worthy of presentation to princes or nobles and of offering at ancestral temple sacrifices.

As with the strictest of laws and the most rigorous of corrective measures, it is impossible to go against it.

Three years is the time for such danger to run its course, and when the danger has come to an end, the situation is reversed. This is why one here is unsuccessful for three years.

In one sense it means repetitive, or \"double,\" and as such refers to the fact that both the upper and the lower trigrams are Kan [Sink Hole], so \"constant\" here describes how dangerous it isâ€”that is, what a multiplicity of danger is involved. In another sense, it refers to the fact than when someone is going to undertake something dangerous, he must first constantly practice how to deal with such matters, for only then might he be successful. And this too is why the term constant is used here. See Zhouyi zhengyi, 3: 33a.
