One should issue one's own city a decree, for it would not be fitting to resort to armed force at once. It would be fitting if one were to set forth to do something. {Kuai [Resolution] is the opposite of Bo [Peeling, Hexagram 23].[[note 1]] By having soft and weak lines convert hard and strong lines, Bo [Peeling] almost goes so far as to finish off all hard and strong lines. By having hard and strong lines take decisive action against soft and weak lines, Kuai [Resolution] acts [to eliminate soft and weak lines] in the same way Bo [Peeling] does to eliminate hard and strong lines. When the hard and strong perish, the Dao of the noble man wanes, and when the soft and weak wane, the dao of the petty man perishes. When the Dao of the noble man wanes, his virtues of strength and rectitude are denied a straight path to action and the power that stems from the threat of punishments cannot be exercised with any ease. Here \"action is taken openly in the king's court,\" for this Dao should be practiced in public.[[note 2]]} ","commentary":"Kuai [Resolution] means to take decisive action. Here the hard and strong take decisive action against the soft and weak. Here one should act with strength yet do so with joy, for this is the way to be decisive yet achieve harmony. {If one \"acts with strength yet do[es] so with joy,\" he shall be \"decisive yet achieve harmony.\" \"Action is taken openly in the king's court,\" for one soft and weak one rides atop five hard and strong ones. {The hard and strong [yang] lines all grow in strength, but the one soft and weak [yin] line acts waywardly. Such a one is condemned to death by all equally; none is averse to it. This is why it is possible for \"action to be taken openly in the king's court.\"} \"A sincere call here means danger\": his danger is now obvious. {The strong and righteous proclaim their order sincerely and openly, so the soft and weak wicked one is put in danger. This is why the text says: \"His danger is now obvious.\"} \"One should issue one's own city a decree, for it would not be fitting to resort to armed force at once.\" {When the hard and strong decide and control things, commands may be proclaimed. \"Issue one's own city a decree\" means to proclaim a command. To take advantage of one's strength \"to resort to armed force at once\" is to emphasize brute force as the means to achieve victory, but such emphasis on brute force to achieve victory is something that all will equally find a cause for suffering.} \"It would be fitting . . . to set forth to do something,\" for the more the hard and strong grow in strength, the more likely it is that a successful conclusion will be had. {The stronger the virtues of the hard and strong grow, the more the wickedness of the soft and weak will wane, and this is why \"it would be fitting . . . to set forth to do something,\" for the Dao [way] is ready-made for success.}"},"image":{"text":"The Lake has risen higher than the Sky: Resolution.

This refers to Top Yin, which occupies the very top of the body [i.e., hexagram]; thus it is referred to as \"the cheekbones.\" Third Yin of Bo [Peeling, Hexagram 23] performs a good deed in responding to Top Yang. When the hard and strong grow in strength, the Dao of the noble man prospers, and when the yin flourish, the dao of the petty man grows strong. As this is so, to assist the yang when one finds oneself at a time when the yin grow strong is good, but to assist the soft and weak at a time when the yang grow strong will result in misfortune. Kuai [Resolution] is a time when the hard and strong grow in strength, yet Third Yang alone responds to Top Yin and in doing so assists the petty man. This is why it \"mean[s] misfortune.\" If a noble man occupies the position of Third Yang, he will surely be capable of casting off any entanglement with Top Yin; that he should be decisive about this he has no doubt. This is why the text says that he \"acts with perfect Resolution.\" However, if Third Yang does not associate with the other yang lines but instead travels alone in pursuit of different ambitions and responds to the petty man [represented by Top Yin], he will suffer hardship and distress by doing so. \"He should encounter such a rain that he should be as if sunk in water,\" and he should feel resentment but would have no place to lay the blame.[[note 8]]} ","commentary":"As \"the noble man acts with perfect Resolution,\" in the end he is without blame."},{"number":4,"text":"Fourth Yang\nThis one's thighs are without skin, and his walking falters.[[note 9]] If he were to allow himself to be led by the ram, regret would disappear, but he might hear what is said but not trust it. {Those below advance with hardness and strength and are not to be warded off by Fourth Yang, so this one is sure to be encroached upon and wounded. He loses the means to keep himself secure, thus \"his thighs are without skin, and his walking falters.\" A ram is so strong and sturdy that it is difficult to move; here it refers to Fifth Yang. As the ruler of the Kuai [Resolution] hexagram, Fifth Yang is not to be encroached upon by those below, so if one at Fourth Yang were to allow himself to be led by Fifth Yang, he could manage to have regret disappearâ€”but nothing more. But this hard and strong one [Fourth Yang] might overreach himself to the extent that he becomes incapable of accepting what is said and instead might try to take charge of his own situation. This is what is meant by \"he might hear what is said but not trust it.\" If he were to set forth in this way, we can know well that misfortune would befall him.[[note 10]]}","commentary":"\"His walking falters,\" for the position is not right for him. \"He might hear what is said but not trust it,\" for his perception is dim. {This is the same as the misfortune of having the ears destroyed in [Top Yang of] Shihe [Bite Together, Hexagram 21].}"},{"number":5,"text":"Fifth Yang\nThe pokeweed is dispatched with perfect Resolution.

They note that Third Yang exceeds the Mean (i.e., it is beyond the central position in the lower trigram), so it is too resolute and acts too harshly; this is why there is misfortune. Even a noble man here runs the risk of traveling alone and getting soaked by rainâ€”an encounter with the \"lake\" of the upper trigram and the yin wetness of Top Yin. It is this that provokes the anger of the sovereign, but Resolution should finally carry the noble man through these trials, so that in the end one at Third Yang will \"be without blame.\" See Zhouyi zhezhong, 6: 22b-23a."},{"number":9,"note":"Cf.
