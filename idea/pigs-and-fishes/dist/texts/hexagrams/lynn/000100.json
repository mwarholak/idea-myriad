It was thought that spring thunder is responsible for rousing things (both plants and animals) to life, as is said in section five of Explaining the Trigrams: \"The myriad things come forth in Zhen [Thunder, Quake].\" Yu [Contentment], of course, consists of Zhen on top of Kun (Earth, Pure Yin). However, Cheng Yi explains this passage somewhat differently: \"The yang force is, to begin with, imprisoned inside the Earth, but when it goes into action, it quits the Earth with shaking and quaking. It begins by being pent up, but when it shakes itself free, it expands and spreads freely and so finds harmony and contentment.

Eyes haughty with pride, its manner is impossible to live with, but here is Third Yin supporting [carrying] and following it, so it is sure to get insulted by it, and this will cause regret.
