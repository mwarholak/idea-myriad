The noble man never fails to illuminate things, but if he were to use an excess of brightness, it would do harm to his powers of scrutiny. When one uses too much scrutiny, though he may complete what has to be done, he will be deficient in the \"vast power to accommodate\" [see Hexagram 2, Kun (Pure Yin), Commentary on the Judgments]. Thus the noble man . . . does not utilize his powers of bright scrutiny to the utmost but instead uses a muted approach, for only then will he be able to treat others with tolerance and bring harmony to the masses.

In particular, they gloss chui qi yi (keeping his wings folded) as \"drooping\" or \"lowering his wings\"â€”as a bird does when wounded. Cheng's comments are the more detailed: Whenever petty men harm a noble man, they harm his ability to act [literally, \"that by which he moves/acts\"]. . . . With his bright perspicacity, the noble man discerns the subtleties underlying trends and events. Although here at the beginning [of Suppression of the Light] there are clues as to why he gets wounded, they are not yet apparent, but the noble man can discern them, and this is why he goes away to avoid such things happening. . . . Awareness of the incipiency of things is a function of the unique vision of the noble man; it is not something that can be recognized by the mass of men. . . . So who among the common mass of men would fail to find his behavior suspicious and peculiar? See Zhouyi zhezhong, 5: 29a-29b."},{"number":9,"note":"Cf.

He rejects Cheng's reading and insists that all the lines represent the junzi (noble man) except Top Yin, and he seems to read yu chu menting much as Wang Bi reads it: \"One obtains the heart . . . by leaving one's gate and courtyard.\" However, unlike Wang, who takes this to mean that one should not try to hide at home but come to court and survive there, in effect, by outwitting the ruler, Zhu thinks that one at Fourth Yin (the lowest position in the upper, Kun [Darkness] trigramâ€”where the force of darkness is at its weakest) has enough integrity of purpose to see things from an external perspective (the perspective of those in the lower, Li [Brightness] trigram) and so knows that he dwells in the midst of Suppression of the Light and that he \"should leave it and go far away.\" See Zhouyi zhezhong, 5: 31b-32b."}]}
