The reason why a youth beset by ignorance seeks me is that he wants me to resolve the uncertainties that he has.

This is why \"an initial rendering of the yarrow stalks should be told, but a second or third would result in violation\" and \"the one who would bring about this violation is the Juvenile Ignorant.\" How could other than Second Yang ever manage \"an initial rendering of the yarrow stalks\"!

None is more perspicacious than the sage, and none is more benighted than the Juvenile Ignorant. \"To take Juvenile Ignorance and cultivate rectitude in it,\" in fact, \"is the meritorious task of the sage.\" As this is so, if one were instead to try to achieve perspicacity by cultivating rectitude [in others], this would be to misconstrue the Dao involved.[[note 2]]} ","commentary":"Meng [Juvenile Ignorance] consists of a dangerous place below a mountain.

The one who is not the Juvenile Ignorant is [Second] Yang. It is always one who does not know who seeks out and asks one who does know; the one who does know does not seek to have things told to him. The unenlightened seeks out the perspicacious; the perspicacious does not solicit the counsel of the unenlightened.

It is also fitting to remove the fetters and shackles of the criminal. As Juvenile Ignorance has been dispersed, matters about which he felt doubt have become clarified. In all such cases, it is appropriate that the criminal have his fetters and shackles removed. . . . If he were to set out imbued with the Correct Dao, the goodness of his actions would keep on increasing, but if he were to set out subject to the dao of punishment, there would be a mean-spirited aspect to what he does.\n See Zhouyi zhengyi, 1: 33a.\n \"Mean-spirited\" translates bilin and is thus a gloss on lin (hard going). Later Neo-Confucians interpret this passage differently.\n Although Cheng Yi seems to agree with Wang and Kong that punishment is inimical to the Dao and that what is really needed is the internalization of the sense of goodness, he differs from them in thinking that removing the \"fetters and shackles\" is a metaphor for the lifting of ignorance itself. Zhu Xi takes another view of how the lifting of ignorance should take place: \"One first ought to punish severely and then for a time release him [from the fetters and shackles] in order to see how he behaves afterwards. If one lets him set out but does not release him from them, this would result in the utmost shame and remorse.\" Wang Anshi and some others take an even different approach: If one does not use severe punishments right at the start to correct small faults but instead frees the ignorant youth from his fetters and shackles, this will inevitably lead to a \"dao of remorse.\" See also Hexagram 62, Xiaoguo (Minor Superiority), Fifth Yin, and note 11 there."},{"number":5,"note":"Cf.

Cheng also thinks that she has discarded the one she rightly ought to respond to (Top Yang) and instead chases after the nearby and convenient\n Second Yang; thus, in his view, she is both greedy and opportunistic.

It is fitting to prevent such banditry.\" Zhu Xi's commentary, however, seems to agree with that of Wang Bi: one should strike at Juvenile Ignorance but avoid excessive force. He also adds the remark: \"All one can do is guard against enticements to evil from without, so that the Juvenile Ignorant can perfect his truth and purity.\" As such, Zhu provides a more specific gloss on \"guard against harassment\" than does Wang Bi (or Kong Yingda).
