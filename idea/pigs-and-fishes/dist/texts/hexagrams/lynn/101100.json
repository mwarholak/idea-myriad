One who achieves mastery over the world and yet denies the insignificant and the obscure the chance to achieve prevalence shall have unending cause for worry. This is why such a one extends the prevalence of Abundance to the utmost and in so doing manages to stay free from worry.

As everything in Heaven and Earth waxes and wanes at the proper moment; is this not even truer for men, even truer for gods and spirits? {Abundance functions in such a way that one comes to grief due to setting or waning. If one were to operate in terms of it at a time when insufficiency prevailed, Abundance still ought to result, but if one were to do so at a time when repletion already existed, satiation would soon occur. As one must not use Abundance as if it were a constant rule, so the text mentions the Dao of how all things ebb and flow.}"},"image":{"text":"Thunder and Lightning arrive together: this constitutes the image of Abundance.

Although they are alike, there is no blame [i.e., even though they are not resonate partners], so if one were to go forth here, he would enjoy esteem.

If he were to set forth, he would reap doubt and enmity, but if he were to have sincerity and develop accordingly, he should have good fortune. {Bu [screen] is a thing that covers over and darkens, that wards off the light. One at Second Yin may be located at a time of brightness and action but is unable to manifest his own Abundance. Not only does this one have his bright and great virtue kept in an inner  place, he also has to abide as a yin in a yin position. What Abundance he has is screened off, hidden away and seen by no one. This is why the text says: \"This one has his Abundance screened off, so the polar constellation could be seen at midday.\" Midday represents the apex of brightness, and the fact that the polar constellation can be seen signifies that here darkness is absolute. This one is located at the apex of brightness and yet his Abundance is screened off. Thus the text says: \"The polar constellation could be seen at midday.\" This one cannot initiate anything himself, so \"if he were to set forth, he would reap doubt and enmity.\" Instead he should tread the middle path and stay in this his rightful place, abide in obscurity and do no evilâ€”be one who has sincerity. Ruo [accordingly] is a rhetorical expression. One who has sincerity can use it to develop his will and shall not be troubled by obscurity. Thus he shall garner good fortune.[[note 5]]} ","commentary":"\"If he were to have sincerity and develop himself accordingly\" means that he should use sincerity to develop his will."},{"number":3,"text":"Third Yang\nThis one has his Abundance shaded, so that even the dim could be seen at midday.

Mei [the dim] refers to luminaries that give off faint, muted light. The resonate partner for Third Yang is at Top Yin, so this one has his will fixed on a yin, so even though one is better off here than at a yin line that occupies a yin position [i.e., Second Yin], he still lacks the wherewithal to free himself from obscurity. This is what is meant when the text says that the Abundance that this one has is so much in shade that \"even the dim could be seen at midday.\" If such a one were to try to shine his light, all this would do would be to let the dim still be seen [i.e., it would be so faint]. When it comes to this one trying to get employed, he should break his right arm instead. As such, he could then do nothing more than keep himself safe, for he would not be worth employing.}","commentary":"\"This one has his Abundance shaded,\" so he must not try to attempt great matters. {His brightness is insufficient.} \"He should break his right arm,\" for he must on no account be employed. {Although he would still have the left one, this would not be good enough for employment.}"},{"number":4,"text":"Fourth Yang\nThis one has his Abundance screened off, so the polar constellation could be seen at midday.

One here does not tread the territory of any proper position but instead keeps himself hidden in deep seclusion, so Top Yin represents a total recluse who has hidden his tracks completely. Not only does he keep his Abundance in his house, he also screens off his family. With his house amply provided for and his family so sheltered, he can live in utmost obscurity. Although he might peer out his door, \"it is lonely, and no one is there,\" because he is abandoned there where he locates himself and where he has sought profound seclusion. This one finds himself at a time of enlightened action and estimable greatness and yet hides himself in profound seclusion with the [mistaken] thought to keep his own conduct lofty. The great Dao already offers deliverance, but he still does not show himself. This recluse will not become a man of worth to the world but instead turns around and runs counter to the Dao. His misfortune is indeed appropriate! For three years the Dao of Abundance has been fully in place. As long as the Dao of good government cannot yet offer deliverance, seclusion is still permissible. But only someone who confuses good government with chaos will remain a recluse after it has begun to offer that deliverance.}","commentary":"\"This one keeps his Abundance in his house,\" which means he soars at the edge of the sky. {This one hides away his light to the utmost degree.[[note 10]]} \"When he peers out his door, it is lonely, and no one is there,\" for he keeps himself hidden. {\"Keeps himself hidden\" means that one can go out but does not go out; it is not a matter of hiding away because it is the right thing to do. When one does not leave his door and courtyard, he might find himself out of step with the moment [or \"miss opportune  moments\"] and so bring misfortune on himself, so how much truer this would be for someone who \"keeps himself hidden\"!
