This explains how the six lines of this hexagram are either out of position [Fifth Yin is the ruler, and this position should have a yang line], have no resonance [First Yin should resonate with Fourth Yin, and Second Yin with Fifth Yin, but they are all yin lines and thus do not], or ride the wrong lines [Fourth Yin rides on top of Third Yang; a yin line should not ride on top of a yang line], yet none of them involve misfortune, blame, regret, or remorse.
