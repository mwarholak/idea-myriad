As a concept, Release means release from troubles and deliverance from danger. When there are no troubles worth setting forth to deal with, as Release has occurred, one should return and thus not stray off the middle path [or \"be in violation of the Mean\"], but if there are troubles such that one should set forth and deal with them, then good fortune will come about only if quick action is taken.

Although First Yin with its softness and weakness occupies a place other than a proper position, when it encounters such a moment as this, it need not worry about incurring blame, and this is why for First Yin \"there is no blame.\" See Zhouyi zhengyi, 4: 24b. According to Wang Bi, the first place in a hexagram is not a proper position for either a yin or a yang line; it is, in effect, a \"positionless\" positionâ€”a \"borderline\" between yin and yang. See section five of Wang's General Remarks. Insignificant (weak), without responsibilities, and at a time when the strong can no longer bully, here one need not worry about incurring blame.
