It is at such a time that this [the Dao of Gu] allows one to take action. When others are already following with delight, this means that they await someone to make laws in order to put their affairs in order. Here is the time to advance virtue and cultivate enterprise, so that when one sets forth he shall achieve prevalence. This is why the text says: \"It provides the opportunity for fundamental prevalence, and so it is fitting to cross the great river.\" Jia [the first of the ten characters in the heavenly branches numbering system (tiangan)] here means \"a newly initiated law.\" One cannot enforce a new law in the same way that one can enforce an old one. Thus, for the three days before [its initiation] and for the three days after, one works to make this law blend in, and only after that does one use it as the basis for punishment. It is in response to some difficult situation that a [new] law is issued, but \"with its [the situation's] ending, one starts all over again\"â€”just as Heaven operates employing the four seasons.}"},"image":{"text":"Below the Mountain, there is Wind: this constitutes the image of Gu [Ills to Be Cured].[[note 2]] In the same way, the noble man stirs the common folk and nourishes their virtue.","commentary":"{\"The hexagram Gu [Ills to Be Cured] signifies a time when there are problems that await someone capable of dealing with them.\" Thus the noble man uses such opportunities to bring succor to the common folk and to cultivate their virtue.[[note 3]]} "},"sequence":{"commentary":"One who gets people to follow him by making them happy inevitably will have problems.
